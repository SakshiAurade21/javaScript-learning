/*
What is filter()?

filter() is a method used with arrays.

    ~ It goes through each element of the array and checks a condition.
    ~ If the condition is true, it keeps that element in a new array.
    ~ If the condition is false, it removes (ignores) that element.

Important: filter() always returns a new array (does not change the original one).

const filterEven=myNumber.filter((num)=>{
    return num%2==0;

/*
ðŸ”¹ forEach vs filter

=> forEach

       ~ Loops through every item in an array.
       ~ Runs some code for each item.
       ~ Does not return a new array.
       ~ You usually use it when you just want to do something (like printing, updating, or storing somewhere else).

But here, no new array is created. Only printing.

=> filter

       ~ Also loops through every item.
       ~ But it returns a new array that contains only those elements which pass a condition (true/false).
       ~ Use when you want to extract specific items from an array.
